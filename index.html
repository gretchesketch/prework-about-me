      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>For those of you who haven’t already guessed, my name is Gretchen. I am happily married to my best friend which has led me to this exact moment where I am writing this introduction. We have been together for 9 years and married for 6. Once struggling servers no working our way to success. We both knew we wanted more so Chris left his server job and put down his guitar to go back to college. With him in school, working towards two bachelors, I was left to support us financially in the meantime. Waiting tables wasn’t really filling the shoes of two incomes or really three if you take out the music gigs. I kept looking for more lucrative opportunities.
        I landed at the post office where I have worked for the last 5 and a half years. The hours were even worse than working as a server, but the pay was immensely better and more reliable. This came at a huge cost however, I hardly got to see my husband, I missed family events and holidays, and any hope of a vacation was dashed. It wasn’t until I had moved up seniority and landed the position of regular carrier on one route where things lightened up. Still not ideal.
        Chris graduated last year and is now a year into his accounting position. This has increased our income significantly allowing me the opportunity to quit my demanding job at the post office and pursue my own education how I see fit. At 29 going back to traditional college just didn’t sound appetizing so I began my search for alternatives where I came across Georgia Tech’s bootcamp programs. The idea of working in IT has always drawn me in so it was kind of a no brainer for me. I applied and am so happy to move on from being a mail carrier and start this new part of my life.

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in a military family, so we didn’t stay in one place for long. Cumming Georgia is the closest thing to a hometown I have.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <pI>can’t say much in the hobby department. I used to love creating art in various mediums, but the demands of my previous job have drained me of all motivation to keep up with my creations. I am a tattoo enthusiast, I play the occasional video game, read maybe 2 books a year, and watch way too much television. I’ll get back to you if this changes. Fingers crossed.></p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don’t know if I have a dream profession more like a desired lifestyle. I want to telecommute and enjoy the freedoms that come with it. I also have many tattoos so an environment that wont pass judgement is, well, at this point a necessity. I always wanted to travel, and my previous position was less than accommodating. I want to work to live, not live to work.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently Dahlonega, Georgia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Being a web developer would open so many doors for me. It could most certainly meet my dream job requirements and is an art form. Just a medium I haven’t tried yet. Also having hand tattoos might seem like less of a drawback to an employer. As I understand the industry is more lenient in that department (appearance).</p>
